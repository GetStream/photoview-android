<p align="center">
ðŸŒ‡ PhotoView is an ImageView component for Android that enables zoom functionality through diverse touch gestures. This project has been forked from ChrisBanes' PhotoView.
</p>

> The aim of this library is to sync up to the recent androidx library, address bugs, enhance features, and distribute the package through Maven Central instead of Jitpack.

## Download
[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.getstream/photoview.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.getstream/photoview)

### Gradle

Add the dependency below to your **module**'s `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation("io.getstream:photoview:1.0.0")
}
```

## Usage

`PhotoView` can be utilized exactly like `ImageView`, as demonstrated in the example below:

```xml
<io.getstream.photoview.PhotoView
    android:id="@+id/phptoView"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:src="@drawable/wallpaper"/>
```

When incorporating third-party image loading libraries like Glide or Coil, images can be loaded as demonstrated in the following examples.

### Coil

```kotlin
val photoView = binding.photoView
photoView.load(IMAGE_URL) {
  crossfade(true)
}
```

### Glide

```kotlin
val photoView = binding.photoView
Glide.with(this)
  .load(IMAGE_URL)
  .into(photoView)
```

Exploring the [sample](https://github.com/GetStream/photoview-android/tree/main/sample) directory reveals a variety of practical examples, including integration with ViewPager, using PhotoView with shared transition elements, utilizing third-party image libraries (such as Coil, Glide, and Picasso), among others.

## Supported Features

- **Effortless Zooming**: Enables zooming capabilities through multi-touch gestures and double-tapping.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Offers seamless scrolling experience with fluid fling motion.
- **Compatibility with Scrolling Parents**: Integrates flawlessly within scrolling containers, like ViewPager, ensuring smooth operation.
- **Matrix Change Notifications**: Alerts the application when the displayed Matrix changes, which is essential for UI adjustments based on the current zoom or scroll position.
- **User Tap Notifications**: Notifies the application when the user interacts with the Photo, facilitating responsive UI actions.
